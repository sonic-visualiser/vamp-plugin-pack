Vamp Plugin Pack
================

#### An installer for various Vamp plugins with redistributable licences

The Vamp Plugin Pack is a cross-platform binary distribution, with
platform-appropriate installer, of a bundle of [Vamp audio analysis
plugins](https://vamp-plugins.org/).

The plugin libraries included in the Vamp Plugin Pack were developed
and published by various different authors and institutions:

* BBC
* Carl Bussey
* Chris Cannam
* Jamie Bullock
* Marsyas Plugins
* Matthias Mauch
* Paul Brossier
* Queen Mary, University of London
* Simon Dixon and Chris Cannam
* University of Alicante

The installer shows more information about each plugin library,
including a link to its homepage where it has one. Please refer to the
installer and to plugin libraries themselves for more details about
the provenance and use of each plugin.

All of the libraries are open source and are redistributable under
open-source licences. The entire pack and the installer may be
redistributed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3,
which is the most restrictive of the set of copyleft licenses in use
by the libraries.

The plugins were collected together, and the installer was written and
published, by Chris Cannam at the [Centre for Digital Music, Queen
Mary University of London](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).
